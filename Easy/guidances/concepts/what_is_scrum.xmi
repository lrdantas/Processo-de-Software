    Scrum is a thin and iterative project management process, which belongs to the &lt;a title=&quot;Agile method&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&quot;>Agile methods&lt;/a> family, sharing the values defined in&#xD;
    the Agile manifesto and applying its fundamental principles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Summary&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here's a summary of Scrum:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;>&#xD;
    Scrum leads to oftenly and regulary showing (every 2 or 4 weeks, depending on &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../Scrum/guidances/termdefinitions/Sprint_494C0C24.html&quot; guid=&quot;_kftWoIHqEduFs9jH8xc4xw&quot;>Sprint&lt;/a>&#xD;
    length) a working (partial) product. Business analysis identifies requirements and defines their priorities. Team gets&#xD;
    organized in order to determine the best way to implement most prioritized requirements. At the end of each Sprint,&#xD;
    everybody can see the actual product working and contribute to make a decision on what's next: either release it as is,&#xD;
    or continue to improve it through an additional sprint before reconsidering again.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Origin&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum is a term from rugby. The process revolves around a strong team looking forward to reaching a goal, as it is the&#xD;
    case with rugby when a pack deploys its collective strength to move forward witht the ball during a scrum.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum particulary focuses on the social and collective aspect of development. Scrum Goal is to improve quality and&#xD;
    productivity, with an empirical approach, relying on autonomous teaming.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Empirism&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An empirical process, thus experience-based, requires a good visibility, frequent inspections and adaptation to&#xD;
    planning changes. This is applied in Scrum through the 2 regulation cycles:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        During Daily Scrums, passed day experience is taken into account to adapt the planning for remaining days in the&#xD;
        sprint.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        During sprint reviews, passed sprint experience is taken into account to adapt the release planning regarding next&#xD;
        sprints.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sprint tasks are not defined very precisely: no start date, no end date, no dependency. Scrum considers that it's not&#xD;
    predictable. Scrum empirism continuously relies on current project state analysis for process control and risk&#xD;
    reduction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Scope&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum does not describe all the software development activities (analysis, design, coding, testing) and must be&#xD;
    considered, rather than a full process, more as a process pattern to use for project and requirement management.&#xD;
    &amp;lt;br0/&amp;gt; Scrum does not provide help to achieve development technical activities. It is Team's job to define by&#xD;
    itself what's the work to do.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Diffusion&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Scrum exists since the 90s and its popularity has been growing for a few years and it has been used by hundreds of&#xD;
    projects around the world. For 3 years now, a certification process has been set up. In November 2006, more than 7000&#xD;
    people had obtained ScrumMaster certification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
