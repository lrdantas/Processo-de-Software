            Overview
        &lt;/h3>Story points are a measurement employed to indicate the effort required to implement a user story, or product backlog
        feature. This page will attempt to provide some clarity on the use and definition of Story Points.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;h3>
            What Do They Represent?
        &lt;/h3>Story points represent some measure of effort that is decided by the team. This maybe days, or weeks, or levels of
        complexity.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;h3>
            What Are They For?
        &lt;/h3>Story points provide a way for a &lt;b>team&lt;/b> to &lt;b>jointly&lt;/b> estimate the amount of work that is necessary to
        implement a feature. They are also used to calculate a teams velocity.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;h3>
            What are they NOT for?
        &lt;/h3>The estimates of one team, cannot be used by a different team, in an attempt to pass an amount of estimated work to
        the other team, or in the more common scenario, to compare the velocities of teams. As you will see in the section below,
        the way estimations are applied is solely by the team after some alignment of thinking. Different teams will estimate
        features based on their own shared experiences, and that cannot be applied or transferred to different teams.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;h3>
            How does a team assign them?
        &lt;/h3>During an estimating meeting a customer will read a story. The team will ask questions about the story and receive
        clarifications or the customers assumptions. Once the team is confident they have all the information that is available,
        they all come up with an estimate.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         In the very rare event that all the estimates by the team are the same, then that is the estimate applied to that story,
        and then they continue with the next story.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         In the more common situation that there are differences of opinions amongst the team, then the person with the highest
        estimate explains their reasoning. The person with lowest will then provide their reasons and assumptions why less time or
        effort is necessary. As this discussion continues, and begins to involve other members of the team, a common understanding
        of potential work and approaches will allow the team to improve their understanding.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         At this point the team is asked to once again come up with an estimate for the story. If there are differences, then the
        discussions continue. If they are aligned then the agreed upon estimate is used for that story. In the situation that out
        of 5 team members you receive 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, the team member with the 3 would be asked if they would mind settling on the
        higher estimate.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;h3>
            What are the range of values?
        &lt;/h3>There are two main types of scales that agilists will use to represent a stories effort estimation. Open linear and a
        Fibonacci derivative scale. Another idea is t-shirt sizes, which can be employed over the top of numerical values.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;h4>
            Linear
        &lt;/h4>
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Scale: 1..10, or 1..5
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>&lt;br />
         
        &lt;h4>
            Predefined
        &lt;/h4>
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Scale: 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 80
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>&lt;br />
         
        &lt;h4>
            Abstract: T-Shirt Size
        &lt;/h4>
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Scale: XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>&lt;br />
         The general thought is teams that are estimating small amounts of work will be a lot more accurate and thus meticulous
        about readjusting the estimates in small increments. For example a team deciding if the estimate should be 1 or 2, it is
        important to decide if the consensus is 1 day or double and have 2 days. However the larger the amount of work, the less
        accurate these estimates can really be. So, it would be difficult for a team to decide if a piece of work should be 8 or 9,
        or for an epic story to be 40 or 41. In those cases it is enough to provide the team with predefined high values that they
        can use as boundaries for their estimates. In the epic story scenario, haggling over whether it should 40 or 80 seems to be
        the right level for the amount of work that is being presented.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         The shirt size idea is a great way to allow the team to express the effort without having to translate it to a numeric
        value. This will aid a team to move away from expressing effort only in days to complete, but allow them to start thinking
        in terms of complexity and effort.</mainDescription>
