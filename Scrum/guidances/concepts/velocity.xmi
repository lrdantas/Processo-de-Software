            Overview
        &lt;/h3>An agile team is able to declare some level of capacity for doing work each iteration. This capacity is used when the
        team goes to a planning session and elects to take on work. The hope is that they only take on what is achievable by the
        team. This metric that provides this determination is called the team velocity.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;h3>
            How Is It Calculated?
        &lt;/h3>The velocity is based on the amount of completed features from past, or historic, sprints. Each feature that is
        accepted into a sprint has gone through some level of team estimation. That estimation is stipulated with &lt;a
        class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../ISM-Scrum/guidances/termdefinitions/story_point_def_B4631389.html&quot;
        guid=&quot;_ZoVtE0SNEdyDx7cbCULuLg&quot;>Story points&lt;/a>. 
        &lt;p>
            It will take 2-3 iterations before a team can get a somewhat accurate velocity determination. Though as teams go from
            iteration to iteration, it is worth noting for observers changes in practices, or maturation in estimation that will
            lead to the refinement of their velocity.
        &lt;/p>&lt;br />
         
        &lt;h3>
            What Does It Measure?
        &lt;/h3>As stated in the overview, the velocity metric measures a particular teams capability to work through stories that
        they have estimated. An example is for a team that for the last 3 sprints has got to a point of producing 20 story points
        worth of features every sprint. That velocity is only useful when the team performs estimates on future features, so that
        they know how much of that work they can pull into a sprint. It is also useful to the product owner to aid in their
        assessment of the remaining work that has been identified for a release.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;h3>
            How Is It Used?
        &lt;/h3>Velocity is used as a way to measure a teams output of sustainable effort. It will be used by the team at planning
        sessions as a &lt;em>tide&lt;/em> mark to ensure they do not take on more work than they can actually perform. It can also be
        used by the team and interested parties to indicate any improvements in the teams performance, or declines in a teams
        performance. In this respect, it should be used as a team management aid to help warn or confirm the changes in working
        practices for a team during a sprint. 
        &lt;p>
            An example might be that a team takes on some process changes. By reviewing the teams velocity after these changes, it
            will be one of many indicators to help the team understand the impact that the change has caused.
        &lt;/p>&lt;br />
         
        &lt;h3>
            Can Team Velocities Be Compared?
        &lt;/h3>Since each team will estimate work in slightly different ways, based on their own working experiences and knowledge,
        the estimates that they create for new features are only &lt;em>accurate&lt;/em> for that team. Thus, relying on estimates that
        the team did not actually make, will not be a true measure of how much work they can take on based on their
        &lt;strong>own&lt;/strong> experiences. 
        &lt;p>
            In short, velocities cannot be used as a way to compare teams.&lt;br />
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>
            &lt;br />
