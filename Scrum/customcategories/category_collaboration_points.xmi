  <mainDescription>Scrum provides meeting opportunities to communicate about the product, project and process.&amp;nbsp; these collaboration
        opportunities all share a common theme, they are all timeboxed.&amp;nbsp; For the most part, the meetings try and ensure that
        the people who will gain the most from the interaction are involved directly.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>Since most of the meetings are specified up front, there is usually a concern that there are too many meetings.&amp;nbsp; The
        meetings have been identified as a way to ensure that communication at specific points in the project lifecycle are carried
        out with the key participants and with clear goals.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Meetings have a clear duration and purpose.&amp;nbsp; A meeting facilitator is responsible for ensuring that the meetings are
        conducted within the specified amount of time, and also to esnure that the participants remain focused.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Participants of a Scrum project should endeavor to collaborate as often as they deem necessary, and not wait for the next
        predefined interaction to occur.&amp;nbsp; Scrum, and Agile in general, is about opening the avenues of communication between
        all participants.&lt;br /></keyConsiderations>
